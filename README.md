# ksql-udf-deep-learning-mqtt-iot
Deep Learning UDF for KSQL for Streaming Anomaly Detection of MQTT IoT Sensor Data

TODO:
Update from my old [KSQL UDF example](https://github.com/kaiwaehner/ksql-fork-with-deep-learning-function) because KSQL now supports UDFs out-of-the-box.

In addition to updating the API, I will also leverage Confluent MQTT Proxy here.
